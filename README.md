# CSC_302_Team_project
A repository for instantiation on cloudlab to complete the team project.

This became one of the most challenging things I have done. It made use of much of my innate understanding of how computers work, as well as tested how well I could learn things I am not so familiar with quickly. I have had to reverse engineer how things worked on one system, and how to then implement them on another. I have also had to learn to reverse engineer products and chase rabbitholes of error logs to find out what needs to be fixed. Overall, I am happy I was able to figure it out. Thanks to Dr. Ngo for this challenging assignment.

Elgg has terrible and very unclear documentation and guides. Maybe they know what is going on, but it gave me one hell of a time, trying to figure out what they meant. This was especially difficult when they list cases that aren't clear if I should follow thier instructions or not. There was much reading between the lines, and guessing at other error questions on the forums, untill I finally realized on my own, due to the behavior of it, where the error probably was coming from. Utilmatly I am left frustrated due to my experience with their less than explicit guides and instructions.
